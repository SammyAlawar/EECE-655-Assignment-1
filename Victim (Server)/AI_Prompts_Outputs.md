Project summary
Victim (Server)
Author: Omar Hijazy

We implement and test IPv4 fragmentation behaviours (normal fragmentation vs overlapping fragments) in an isolated VM lab.
Goals:

produce reproducible on-wire traces (PCAP) for normal and overlapping fragments,

detect and log fragment overlaps and byte-level conflicts,

This repo contains:

a UDP echo victim used to check whether reassembled UDP datagrams are delivered to apps, and

a verbose fragment detector that prints every fragment seen and reports byte-level conflicts (overlaps with differing bytes).

Files (short)

udp_echo.py — simple UDP echo server / listener used on the victim VM. Run it to show whether reassembled UDP datagrams reach the application. 


detect_overlap_verbose.py — verbose detector using Scapy: prints per-fragment lines (start/end/frag_off/MF), stores fragments per flow, and prints >>> OVERLAP CONFLICT <<< when two fragments overlap and the overlapping bytes differ.

Requirements:

On each VM (attacker / victim) you will need:

=> Python 3.10+ (or 3.x)

=> scapy (sudo pip3 install scapy) — detector & attacker scripts use Scapy

=> sudo/root 

to install:
sudo apt update
sudo pip3 install scapy

How to run:
1) Start the victim listener (UDP echo):
=> On the victim VM:
sudo python3 udp_echo.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9999

=> Output when it receives data:

[*] UDP echo listening on 0.0.0.0:9999 (press Ctrl+C to stop)
RECV: b'HELLO' from ('192.168.10.20', 4444)

2) Start the verbose detector
=> On the victim VM (or a sniffing VM that sees attacker packets):
sudo python3 detect_overlap_verbose.py --iface enp0s3 --port 9999

=> Typical detector fragment line:

[FRAG] 192.168.10.20->192.168.10.10 id=43601 proto=17 frag_off=0 start=0 end=1472 MF=1 len=1472


Expected outputs & how to read them:

* Detector lines: one per fragment. Fields: src->dst id=... proto=... frag_off=<ip.frag> start=<byte> end=<byte> MF=<0|1> len=<rawlen>.

* (>>> OVERLAP CONFLICT <<<): a definite sign attacker produced overlapping fragments that differ at the same byte positions (conflict).

* udp_echo receives nothing: likely causes:

	* fragments had a gap (off-by-8) or ordering issue → kernel rejects reassembly,

	* UDP detects overlap after reassembly → kernel drops packet

	* final fragment missing or malformed (first fragment must contain UDP header).

can you please help me to turn this README file to be formatted in a cleaner way? like with headers and bullets points and stuff

# README

## Project summary

**Victim (Server)**
**Author:** Omar Hijazy

This repository provides tools and examples to implement and test IPv4 fragmentation behaviours in an isolated VM lab. It focuses on producing reproducible on-wire traces (PCAPs) for normal and overlapping fragments, detecting byte-level fragment overlaps/conflicts.

---

## Goals

* Produce reproducible PCAP traces for:

  * normal IPv4 fragmentation
  * overlapping fragments (malicious)
* Detect and log fragment overlaps and byte-level conflicts

---

## Repository contents (short)

* `udp_echo.py` — simple UDP echo server / listener used on the victim VM. Start this to verify whether reassembled UDP datagrams reach the application.
* `detect_overlap_verbose.py` — verbose fragment detector (uses Scapy).

  * Prints one line per fragment (start/end/frag_off/MF/etc.)
  * Stores fragments by flow and prints `>>> OVERLAP CONFLICT <<<` when two fragments overlap and overlapping bytes differ.

---

## Requirements

On each VM (attacker / victim) you will need:

* Python 3.10+ (or Python 3.x)
* `scapy` (detector & attacker scripts use Scapy)
* `sudo` / root privileges

### Install (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo pip3 install scapy
```

---

## How to run

### 1) Start the victim UDP echo listener

Run on the victim VM:

```bash
sudo python3 udp_echo.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9999
```

**Expected output when it receives data**

```
[*] UDP echo listening on 0.0.0.0:9999 (press Ctrl+C to stop)
RECV: b'HELLO' from ('192.168.10.20', 4444)
```

This shows that the kernel reassembled the fragments and delivered the UDP datagram to the application.

---

### 2) Start the verbose fragment detector

Run on the victim VM:

```bash
sudo python3 detect_overlap_verbose.py --iface enp0s3 --port 9999
```

Default behavior: listens on `enp0s3` for UDP to port `9999` **OR** for fragmented IP traffic.

**Typical detector fragment line**

```
[FRAG] 192.168.10.20->192.168.10.10 id=43601 proto=17 frag_off=0 start=0 end=1472 MF=1 len=1472
```

Fields explained:

* `src->dst` — packet source and destination
* `id=...` — IP identification
* `proto=...` — IP protocol (e.g., 17 for UDP)
* `frag_off=...` — fragment offset field
* `start=<byte>` `end=<byte>` — byte range within the original datagram
* `MF=<0|1>` — More Fragments flag
* `len=<rawlen>` — raw fragment length

---

## Detector outputs & interpretation

* **One line per fragment** — you will see each fragment as it arrives.
* **`>>> OVERLAP CONFLICT <<<`** — definite sign an attacker produced overlapping fragments whose overlapping bytes differ (byte-level conflict).
* **If `udp_echo` receives nothing**, likely reasons:

  * fragments had a gap (off-by-8) or ordering issue → kernel rejects reassembly
  * UDP detects overlap after reassembly → kernel drops packet
  * final fragment missing or malformed (first fragment must contain UDP header)

---

## Example flows to test

1. **Normal fragmentation**: attacker sends properly fragmented packets that reassemble correctly — `udp_echo` should show the payload.
2. **Overlapping fragments (malicious)**: attacker sends overlapping fragments with differing bytes in overlap — the detector should print `>>> OVERLAP CONFLICT <<<`.

here ChatGPT provided an alternative detector script that i copy-pasted it and then tested it, and it worked just fine

#### B) ASK: coding the `udp_echo.py` script:

here i was asking him about the method we used to detect the incoming packets (using tcpdump), so we later managed to change it to an executable udp listener named `udp_echo.py`

---
#### B) REPLY: ChatGPT responded with the following prompt: (I used it as is then made some minor adjustments)
---

````
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# udp_echo.py - simple UDP echo server
import socket
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--host', default='0.0.0.0')
parser.add_argument('--port', type=int, default=9999)
args = parser.parse_args()

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.bind((args.host, args.port))
print(f"[*] UDP echo listening on {args.host}:{args.port} (press Ctrl+C to stop)")
try:
    while True:
        data, addr = s.recvfrom(4096)
        print("RECV:", data, "from", addr)
        s.sendto(data, addr)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("[!] Stopping.")
finally:
    s.close()

````

which we later added a line in it `s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) ` directly before the  `s.bind((args.host, args.port))` line as seen below

this addition was because when I was running the udp listener before, it was holding the socket and failing each time i try to rerun it again, so it was always giving me the error seen in the below image

### 3) Others:

---

Other than those prompts, I was using ChatGPT for assistance in helping me set up the VMs and launch them (due to my limited knowledge with such fields) where it guided me into creating the closed network between the VMs to be able to safely test the attacking/detecting processes.
