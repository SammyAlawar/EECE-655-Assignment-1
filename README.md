# IPV4 Fragment Overlap 
This repo contains tools for an IPV4 fragment overlap lab. The `Attacker/` folder implements a tool that crafts and sends normal, fragmented, and intentionally overlapping IPv4 fragments; the `Victim (Server)/README.md` folder contains a detector that inspects incoming fragments. Detailed usage and examples are in `Attacker/README.md` and `Victim (Server)/README.md`.
